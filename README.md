## Assumptions

I'm using Ruby version `2.6.10p210` because that's what's installed on my machine, I assume the code works as expected on more recent Ruby versions or that you can use something like RVM to use 2.6.10.

I've also assumed the disparity between example three's input and output is unintentional ("3 imported boxes" vs "3 imported box") and assert that the input's item description prevails.

## Install testing dependencies
```
bundle install --binstubs
```
